# Human-Drone Interaction Conference

## Overview  
I contributed to a cross-disciplinary research initiative aimed at developing a conceptual framework for utilizing drones to deliver food to rural, food-insecure communities. This collaboration involved faculty from Virginia Tech specializing in nutrition and mechanical engineering.  

## Conference Presentation  
The resulting paper underwent peer review and was presented at the **IEEE Mipro Conference** held in Opatija, Croatia.  

### Research Areas  
- **Drone Regulations**: Addressing compliance with local and international drone laws.  
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Understanding community-specific dietary needs.  
- **Nutritional Supplements**: Identifying essential nutrients to be included in deliveries.  
- **Engineering Education**: Exploring how drone technology integrates with curricula in schools and universities.  

## Published Research  
The research was documented in a paper, accessible here:
