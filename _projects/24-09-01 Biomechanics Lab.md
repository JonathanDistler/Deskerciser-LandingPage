### Contributions to Soft Robotics at Virginia Tech

During my time at **Virginia Tech** in the **Biomechanics Lab** under Dr. Noel Naughton, I contributed to groundbreaking advancements in soft robotics. Here are some highlights:

---

#### **Prototyping Methods**
- Developed innovative approaches for a soft-robotic snake using a McKibben Actuator (https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/80403).
- Focused on an inner core inspired by a "Chinese-Finger Trap" mechanism: elongation results in a larger diameter, while shrinkage leads to a smaller diameter.

---

#### **H-Bot Control System**
- Designed and implemented a control system to:
   - Synchronize and time-stamp ultrasound images of octopus.
   - Achieve accurate surface scans of soft tissue using **MATLAB** and serial communication techniques.

---

#### **Soft Robotic Muscle Prototype**
- Collaborated on engineering a novel prototype capable of:
   - Expanding and contracting to exact diameters and lengths.
   - Analyzing material properties rigorously.
   - Problem-solving and rapid prototyping effectively.
