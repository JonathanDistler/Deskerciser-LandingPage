Landing page for the ODP 7 project as a part of MAE 2250 (Mechanical Design). The goal of this landing page is to highlight the originally designed prototype that has been developed over the course of the SP 25 semester by Jonathan, Joseph, Ian, Mattew, and Eduardo.

## **Deskerciser Concept**

The initial concept for the prototype was an office chair that could transform into a bench press. Based on interviews with young adults—most of whom lived in smaller spaces like apartments or dormitories and were not homeowners—we found that one of their biggest challenges was finding the time or energy to exercise after a long day of work or school. Common issues included long commutes to gyms, limited operating hours, or simply feeling too exhausted to go. 

Our product, the **Deskerciser**, is designed to directly address this issue. The core idea is a desk chair that fits seamlessly into any living space and can quickly convert into a functional gym bench, allowing the user to perform a variety of exercises. The **Deskerciser** includes features tailored for both compactness and support during workouts, making it ideal for small-space living.
